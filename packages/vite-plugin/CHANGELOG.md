## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 86adbec: Sometimes during development, an extension page may open before the
  service worker has a chance to control fetch. The HTML file will load from the
  file system, but the script tag might load from the dev server. This PR adds a
  precontroller loader plugin to the dev server so that the extension page will
  reload and the fetch handler will get the real HTML file from the server.
